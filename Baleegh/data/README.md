# Data
Anything that has to do with data, including collection, scraping, cleaning, uploading to huggingface...

### Raw
- Where each source of data is collected, then seperately transformed to be in the cleanest form possible for training.

### Processed
- Where each cleaned data source is added to the main dataset and transformed to training norms (remove diacritics, max length, etc...)
